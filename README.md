Auto musicL Maker

A comprehensive tool for generating musicL playlist XML files from Podcasting 2.0 music feeds, featuring both a web interface and automated playlist generation scripts.

## üìã Templates & Examples

### Blank Template
Use `docs/blank-playlist-template.xml` as a starting point for manual playlist creation. The template includes:
- Numbered placeholders for easy reference (e.g., `[1-AUTHOR_NAME]`, `[2-PLAYLIST_NAME]`)
- Step-by-step instructions in XML comments
- Complete XML structure with all required fields
- Direct link to example playlist for reference

### Example Playlist
See `docs/doerfelverse-playlist-example.xml` for a complete example of a generated musicL playlist with 126 tracks from the Into The Doerfel-Verse podcast. This example demonstrates the proper XML structure, source feed attribution, and musicL formatting.

## üîß Automated Playlist Generation

### Available Scripts
- `node scripts/create-playlist-template.js` - Template for creating new playlist generation scripts
- `node scripts/create-doerfelverse-playlist.js` - Example script for generating Into The Doerfel-Verse playlist

### Features
- Automatically extracts existing `podcast:remoteItem` elements from source feeds
- Generates RFC 4122 v4 UUIDs for playlist and item GUIDs
- Standardized XML structure with `<author>` at top, `<image>` above `<podcast:medium>`
- Source feed attribution via `<podcast:txt purpose="source-feed">` tags
- Consistent formatting across all playlists
- No XML declaration (clean RSS format)

## üìù Technical Notes
- The app preserves the original channel `<link>` from the source feed
- The generator sets `podcast:medium` to `musicL` and extracts all `<podcast:remoteItem>` entries found in the source feed
- A local dev proxy exists at `/api/proxy` to avoid CORS; production uses a Vercel serverless function at `api/proxy.js`
- All playlists follow the same XML structure for consistency
