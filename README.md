## üîß Automated Playlist Generation

### Available Scripts
- `node scripts/create-doerfelverse-playlist.js` - Generate Into The Doerfel-Verse playlist
- `node scripts/create-playlist-template.js` - Template for creating new playlists

### Features
- Automatically extracts existing `podcast:remoteItem` elements from source feeds
- Generates RFC 4122 v4 UUIDs for playlist and item GUIDs
- Standardized XML structure with `<author>` at top, `<image>` above `<podcast:medium>`
- Blank image URLs ready for custom artwork
- Consistent formatting across all playlists

## üìù Technical Notes
- The app preserves the original channel `<link>` from the source feed
- The generator sets `podcast:medium` to `musicL` and extracts all `<podcast:remoteItem>` entries found in the source feed
- A local dev proxy exists at `/api/proxy` to avoid CORS; production uses a Vercel serverless function at `api/proxy.js`
- All playlists follow the same XML structure for consistency
